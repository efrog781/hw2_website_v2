After downloading the html template, I was confused on how to use it since wheat I tried was not woring. 
At first I just copied the code from the index file in the template and put it in my index file but then i 
jusr got a bunch of text on my home page. Then I spent too much time thinking I needed to insert a link to Bootstrap v5.3.3 styles and javascript before I started the copied code. That didn't help. Then I decided 
to go to youtube and user @howtechweb in this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hb_MSwbP8w
explained that I needed to copy the files assoicated with the template intot he local folder on my drive 
ralted to the website project
